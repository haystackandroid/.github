Here is an online archive for the GitHub user `nightsense`, aka
`haystackandroid`, who was best known as the author of a number of
awesome low contrast color schemes before they decided to remove
their GitHub account in 2022.

If you happen to have a recent clone of their deleted repositories,
hopefully in your `~/.local/share/nvim`, `~/.vim`, or `~/emacs.d`,
you're encouraged to join this organization and share your precious
archives with others.  Please ask us for `git push` access on the
[discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/nightsense/discussions).
